                        <p class="lead mb-4">
                            Founded in May 2019, un-Traditional Magick has been working to provide a safe inclusive space to learn for all people, regardless of faith, creed, tradition, identity or any other protected class.
                            un-Traditional Magick accepts all who wish to learn and grow with a community.
                            Our Chancellor can often be quoted saying: "If it is not fun, you are doing it wrong!" And this cannot be any more true to our mission and cause.
                            Magick is supposed to be fun, and is an integral part of everyone's being. This is a fundamental part of our beliefs and we hold to this everyday.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">
                            Our goal is to provide the safe space to learn because there has always been some stigma about learning other cultures and religions.
                            We have provided this space because of rather dear members in the past who have expressed concerned with being publicly "outed" and we respect this.
